# Failing forward

Whenever there is a roll you've got to know two things.

* What is the opportunity on success
* What is the danger on failure

For example: a perception roll offers an opportunity to see bandits
sneaking up on you before they attack, with the danger of being
surprised by the attack. Rather than an opportunity to notice a secret
door where the danger is simply not noticing it.

What about when there is a time delay between the opportunity and the
danger? Like say the danger of believing a lie is that you will end up
sleeping in the room the assassin expects you to be in that night. The
opporunity is to distrust the host giving an opportunity to prepare
for intruders.

Maybe we can use bane tokens for this? the GM can spend bane tokens
for challenges that would normally be unfair without a roll and an
opportunity to change course or prepare.

Host: "you'll be safe here [lie]"
GM: "preception check, the danger is a bane token"
Player: fails roll

GM: gets bane token and later spends it on the assassins, but could
    spend it on something unrelated? like a random encounter on the
    way out of town? might work, not super satisfying though.

Maybe rather than a bane token its more like a string from monsterhearts.

Like fail perception check, host gains a string on you. can pull that
string when the assassin strikes and you roll for surprise. If you
pass the perception check you get a string on the host which you can
use while in their domain etc. Or in spire terms, you gain the domain
"Host".

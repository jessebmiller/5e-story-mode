# Promises and Progress
---

from (Brandon Sanderson's lectures)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSH_xM-KC3Zv-79sVZTTj-YA6IAqh8qeQ] (plot #1 I think)

Stories establish promises at the beginning

* We're going to save the universe
* We're going to face the dragon reborn
* These two will fall in love
* We're going to destroy the ring
* The mother of dragons will sit on the iron throne

Games make promises and progress too.

* You're going to change the spire
* You're going to get the treasure
* you're going to solve the mystery

5e story mode promices (lecture #9)

* You will bond with your friends (likability)
* you will become powerful (competance)
* you will gain influence and responsibility (proactivity)

You don't have to progress on all of these! The Mountain (GoT) pretty
much only progressed on the power track. The Hound as well, though a
little on bonds.

John Snow progressed on influence and responsibility more than power

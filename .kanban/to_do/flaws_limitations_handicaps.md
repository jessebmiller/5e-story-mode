# Flaws Limitations Handicaps
---

(sanderson lecture)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSH_xM-KC3Zv-79sVZTTj-YA6IAqh8qeQ]

Characters have

* Flaws: things they have controll over and should have resolved by now
  * Example: drug addictions, anger issues, etc.
* Handicaps: things they don't have control over but can overcome
  * Example: Born blind, poor, black etc.
* Limitations: things they may or may not have controll over but isn't
  to be overcome
  * Example: Spiderman's love and care for his grandma, dependant family, etc.

There are implicit promises in flaws and handicaps specific to the
character and their growth, they will resolve and overcome them.

There is an implicit promise in limitations, they will cause trouble
but the cahracter will stay steadfast.

In game terms, characters should have at least some of these,
informing character motivation and offering hooks for play.

Mechanically they are opportunities for XP. When the promises these
represent are fulfilled... gain XP.

# Romance and bonds
---

D&D NEEDS MORE ROMANCE! But it needs structure!

It also friendship and comrodery, the two overlap a bunch.

Romance at the table really needs a lot of ways to disclaim decision
making in order to give strong bleed resistance, so character romance
feels safe.

Make a pair of moves similar to CfB meddle and theorize that records
some pool of bonding progress (relationship beats) up to a threshold
when we discover what the relationship has become.

Types of relationship beats

* See their flaws, accepts them
* Sees their virtue, respects them
* They Change me for the better
* They earn my trust
* Powerfully indescribably drawn to them

When you have a beat, write down the circumstances causing the beat so
you remember when you roll for the bond.

When you (both if PCs) want, roll to form a bond.

Decide together what rank bond you want (higher is better, it's like
another stat)

Each secretly decide the nature of the bond

* Friendship
* Romance
* Professional

Roll + number of beats between you, if you roll higher than the rank
you get a bond. Reveal the nature of the bond you wanted. If they
match you have a bond with that nature. If they don't match the bond
is strained until you resolve it.

# open questions

* What does it mean for a bond to be strained?
* What can you do with a bond? How does it help?
  - you gain XP when you get it...

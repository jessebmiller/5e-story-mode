Dozenal dice

* Controlled: roll 3d4
* Standard:   roll 2d6
* Desparate:  roll 1d12

Add 4 plus any modifiers the D&D rules add

Advantage: roll 1 more die of the same size and drop the lowest
Disadvantage: roll 1 more ide of the same size and drop the highest

This gets you a max roll of 16. and an average roll of 11 (before modifiers)

In order to get rolls up to 20 you'll need to depend on modifiers or
preparation dice.

When you roll in a situation you prepared for roll and add prep dice.
When you prepare for a specific situation set that situations prep die
to d2. As you further prepare for that situation either add another
d2, or roll the pool in a reverse usage die manner. All dice in the
pool that roll their max are increased along the following die chain.
d2 -> d3 -> d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 -> d12

When you prepare for a situation, there is a bit of a promise that the
situation will come about in one way or antoher.


Examples of prep:
* In a fight I might memtally prepare for a lunge
* In a dungeon I might prepare for a monster to attack from behind
* when setting up camp I might prepare for bandits to attack

Always say how. How do we give this teeth? Maybe the method determines
where along the die chain you start? GM chooses, good ideas get a d4
or even d6 to start?
